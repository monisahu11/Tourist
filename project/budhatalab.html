                <p>Swami Vivekanand Sarovar is also called Burha Thalab which means old lake. Fenced by a number of
                    trees, especially palm trees, it is a tranquil place to visit. There are several food stalls just
                    outside the park that provide cheap and good quality street food. Apart from that, the lake is a
                    popular picnic spot and a joggers paradise. The best time to visit the lake is in the evening, just
                    before sunset.</p>

                <p>
                    According to popular belief from what the legends have state, Swami Vivekanand was believed to have
                    visited the lake for a bath every mornings during his 2- year stay in Raipur. He is believed to have
                    rested beside the pool too. Hence, the lake has been named after the great saintly person. The lake
                    was mentioned in the news in recent times for the increase in its pollution levels. Owing it to the
                    people in the neighbourhood who use the lake for cleansing purposes thus contaminating it. However,
                    measures are being taken by the government to restore its purity.</p1>

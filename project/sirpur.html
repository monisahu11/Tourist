                <p>Sirpur town owns a lot of history to its name. This town is an integral part of the Mahasamund
                    district
                    of the central Indian state, Chhattisgarh. River Mahanadi flows through it. This beautiful place wad
                    a
                    vital town in the era of Lord Buddha. This holy place served as an important center for Buddhists
                    right
                    from 6th to 10th century. This place has the honor of the great Buddhist monk Dalai Lama visiting it
                    in
                    the year 2013. People believe that this place was once buried under mud in the 12th century and
                    later it
                    was rediscovered. When it comes to tourism, Sirpur has the perfect blend of Hindu and Buddhist
                    monuments.</p>

                <p>You can literally relive the history and can get mesmerized at the same time by the beauty of the
                    brick
                    formations here at the Laxman temple in Sirpur. The symmetry and the carving on the walls of this
                    temple
                    are really worth watching. Many inscriptions are inscribed on the pillars of the temple, which
                    explain
                    the lifestyle of the common people of that era. This man-made architectural wonder has been a
                    constant
                    source of inspiration for many architects.</p>

                <p>Sirpur, also referred to as Shripur, Sripura or Sripur in ancient Indian texts and inscriptions, is a
                    major archaeological site along the Mahanadi River.Sirpur was capital of Panduvanshi dynasty in
                    ancient
                    times.</p>
                <p> The site has been significant for its temple ruins of Rama and Lakshmana of the Ramayana fame, as
                    well
                    as those related to Shaivism, Shaktism, Buddhism and Jainism. The site excavations after 1950,
                    particularly after 2003, have yielded 22 Shiva temples, 5 Vishnu temples, 10 Buddha Viharas, 3 Jain
                    Viharas, a 6th/7th century market and snana-kund. The site shows extensive syncretism, where
                    Buddhist
                    and Jain statues or motifs intermingle with Shiva, Vishnu and Devi temples.</p1>

                <p>The location is mentioned in the memoirs of the Chinese traveler Xuanzang as a location of
